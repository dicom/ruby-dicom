module DICOM

  # This is a convenience class for handling anonymization of DICOM files.

  class Anonymizer
    include Logging

    # An AuditTrail instance used for this anonymization (if specified).
    attr_reader :audit_trail
    # The file name used for the AuditTrail serialization (if specified).
    attr_reader :audit_trail_file
    # A boolean that if set as true will cause all anonymized tags to be blank instead of get some generic value.
    attr_accessor :blank
    # A boolean that if set as true will cause all anonymized tags to be get enumerated values, to enable post-anonymization identification by the user.
    attr_accessor :enumeration
    # The identity file attribute.
    attr_reader :identity_file
    # A boolean that if set as true, will make the anonymization remove all private tags.
    attr_accessor :remove_private
    # The path where the anonymized files will be saved. If this value is not set, the original DICOM files will be overwritten.
    attr_accessor :write_path
    # A boolean indicating whether or not UIDs shall be replaced when executing the anonymization.
    attr_accessor :uid
    # The DICOM UID root to use when generating new UIDs.
    attr_accessor :uid_root
    # An array of UID tags that will be anonymized if the uid option is used.
    attr_accessor :uids

    # Creates an Anonymizer instance.
    #
    # === Notes
    #
    # * To customize logging behaviour, refer to the Logging module documentation.
    #
    # === Parameters
    #
    # * <tt>options</tt> -- A hash of parameters.
    #
    # === Options
    #
    # * <tt>:audit_trail</tt> -- String. A file name path. If the file contains old audit data, these are loaded and used in the current anonymization.
    # * <tt>:uid</tt> -- Boolean. If true, all (top level) UIDs will be replaced with custom generated UIDs. To preserve UID relations in studies/series, the AuditTrail feature must be used.
    # * <tt>:uid_root</tt> -- String. An organization (or custom) UID root to use when replacing UIDs.
    #
    # === Examples
