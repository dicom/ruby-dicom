module DICOM

  # The DRead class parses the DICOM data from a binary string.
  #
  # The source of this binary string is typically either a DICOM file or a DICOM network transmission.
  #
  # === Notes
  #
  # In addition to reading files that are compliant to DICOM 3 Part 10, the philosophy of the
  # Ruby DICOM library is to feature maximum compatibility, and as such it will also
  # successfully read many types of 'DICOM' files that deviate in some way from the standard.
  #
  class DRead

    # A boolean which reports the explicitness of the DICOM string, true if explicit and false if implicit.
    attr_reader :explicit
    # A boolean which reports the endianness of the post-meta group part of the DICOM string (true for big endian, false for little endian).
    attr_reader :file_endian
    # An array which records any status messages that are generated while parsing the DICOM string.
    attr_reader :msg
    # A DObject instance which the parsed data elements will be connected to.
    attr_reader :obj
    # A boolean which records whether the DICOM string contained the proper DICOM header signature of 128 bytes + 'DICM'.
    attr_reader :signature
    # A boolean which reports whether the DICOM string was parsed successfully (true) or not (false).
    attr_reader :success

    # Creates a DRead instance.
    # Parses the DICOM string, builds data element objects and connects these with the DObject instance.
    #
    # === Parameters
    #
    # * <tt>obj</tt> -- A DObject instance which the parsed data elements will be connected to.
    # * <tt>string</tt> -- A string which specifies either the path of a DICOM file to be loaded, or a binary DICOM string to be parsed.
    # * <tt>options</tt> -- A hash of parameters.
    #
    # === Options
    #
    # * <tt>:bin</tt> -- Boolean. If true, the string parameter will be interpreted as a binary DICOM string instead of a path string.
    # * <tt>:no_meta</tt> -- Boolean. If true, the parsing algorithm is instructed that the binary DICOM string contains no meta header.
    # * <tt>:syntax</tt> -- String. If specified, the decoding of the DICOM string will be forced to use this transfer syntax.
