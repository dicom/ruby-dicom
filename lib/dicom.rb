# Loads the files that are used by Ruby DICOM.
#
# The following classes are meant to be used by users of Ruby DICOM:
# * DObject - for reading, manipulating and writing DICOM files.
# * Element, Sequence, Item, Parent, Elemental - users who wish to interact with
#   their DICOM objects will use these classes/modules.
# * ImageItem - Image related methods are found in this class.
# * DClient - for client side network communication, like querying, moving & sending DICOM files.
# * DServer - for server side network communication: Setting up your own DICOM storage node (SCP).
# * Anonymizer - a convenience class for anonymizing your DICOM files.
#
# The rest of the classes visible in the documentation generated by RDoc are
# in principle 'private' classes, which are mainly of interest to developers.
