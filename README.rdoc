= RUBY DICOM

Ruby DICOM is a small and simple library for handling DICOM in Ruby. DICOM (Digital Imaging
and Communications in Medicine) is a standard for handling, storing, printing,
and transmitting information in medical imaging. It includes a file format definition
and a network communications protocol. Ruby DICOM supports reading from, editing
and writing to this file format. It also features basic support for select network
communication modalities like querying, moving, sending and receiving files.


== INSTALLATION

  gem install dicom


== BASIC USAGE

=== Load & Include

  require 'dicom'
  include DICOM

=== Read, modify and write

  # Read file:
  obj = DObject.new("some_file.dcm")
  # Extract the Patient's Name value:
  obj.patients_name.value
  # Add or modify the Patient's Name element:
  obj.patients_name = "Anonymous"
  # Remove a data element from the DICOM object:
  obj.pixel_data = nil
  # Write to file:
  obj.write("new_file.dcm")

=== Modify using tag strings instead of dictionary method names

  # Extract the Patient's Name value:
  obj.value("0010,0010")
  # Modify the Patient's Name element:
  obj["0010,0010"].value = "Anonymous"
  # Remove a data element from the DICOM object:
  obj.remove("7FE0,0010")

=== Extracting information about the DICOM object

  # Display a short summary of the file's properties:
  obj.summary
  # Print all data elements to screen:
  obj.print
  # Convert the data element hierarchy to a nested hash:
  obj.to_hash

=== Handle pixel data

  # Retrieve the pixel data in a Ruby Array:
  obj.pixels
  # Load the pixel data to an numerical array (NArray):
  obj.narray
  # Load the pixel data to an RMagick image object and display it on the screen:
  obj.image.display

=== Transmit a DICOM file

  # Send a local file to a server (PACS) over the network:
  node = DClient.new("10.1.25.200", 104)
  node.send("some_file.dcm")

=== Start a DICOM server

  # Initiate a simple storage provider which can receive DICOM files of all modalities:
  s = DServer.new(104, :host_ae => "MY_DICOM_SERVER")
  s.start_scp("C:/temp/")

=== Logging settings

  #   require 'dicom'
  include DICOM
  require 'logger

  # logging to STDOUT with DEBUG level
  Logging.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
  Logging.level = Logger::DEBUG

  # logging to file
  Logging.logger = Logger.new('my_logfile.log')

  # Examples from Logger doc:

  # Create a logger which ages logfile once it reaches a certain
  # size. Leave 10 "old log files" and each file is about 1,024,000
  # bytes.
  #
  Logging.logger = Logger.new('foo.log', 10, 1024000)

  #  Create a logger which ages logfile daily/weekly/monthly.
  #
  Logging.logger = Logger.new('foo.log', 'daily')
  Logging.logger = Logger.new('foo.log', 'weekly')
  Logging.logger = Logger.new('foo.log', 'monthly')


  For more information please read the Logger documentation.
=== IRB Tip

When working with Ruby DICOM in irb, you may be annoyed with all the information
that is printed to screen, regardless if you have set verbose as false. This is because
in irb every variable loaded in the program is automatically printed to the screen.
A useful hack to avoid this effect is to append ";0" after a command.
Example:
  obj = DObject.new("some_file.dcm") ;0
